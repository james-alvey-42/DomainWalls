# Domain Walls

This is a simple implementation of a numerical solution to the Klein-Gordon equation in C++. The repository also includes a Makefile, so the executable can be built by running;

```
make domain
```

in the home directory. To start again, run `make clean` and to remove the output of the code, use `make data-clean`.

## Output

The output of the code for a domain wall configuration is illustrated below;

To make the gif after running the `./domain` executable, run `make gif`.
